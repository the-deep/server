The Problem
------------

**Manual Entry Wasn’t Made For 21st Century Crises**.

Over the past 20 years, more than 7,300 natural disasters were recorded worldwide, affecting more than 
4 billion people across the globe and generating $2.97 trillion in economic losses (UNDRR). 
The colossal effort to manually collect, track, translate, store, verify, and share critical data in the wake of these disasters has created overwhelming, and at times, insurmountable challenges for humanitarian responders— jeopardizing accurate decision making during a crisis
and hindering global ability to prevent and abate future disasters. That’s where DEEP was born.

The Solution
-------------

**Remove Collaboration Barriers, Improve Response Time, Save More Lives**.

DEEP is a platform built with AI in mind to centralize, accelerate, and strengthen inter-agency response to humanitarian crises
at national and field levels. The free, open source tool was developed by field responders in the wake of the devastating 2015
Nepal earthquakes, and has since become a go-to resource for leading global humanitarian organizations, including UNHCR, UNICEF,
UN OCHA, and the IFRC.Today, DEEP hosts the largest analysis framework repository in the international humanitarian sector, 
hosting more than 85,000 carefully annotated response documents and connecting more than 3,000 expert users worldwide.

Since its inception, DEEP has been used to inform more than 1,800 international humanitarian projects whose scopes are estimated to impact
more than 98 million people, including USAID’s response to COVID-19, ACAPS’s response to the Rohingya crisis, and UNHCR and IFRC’s response
to the Venezuela migrations crisis. More than two-thirds of individuals in areas where DEEP is utilized earn less than $5 USD per day.
