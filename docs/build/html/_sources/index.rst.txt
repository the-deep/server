Introduction
------------

DEEP is an intelligent web-based platform offering a suite of collaborative tools tailored towards humanitarian crisis responses. 
It includes common analysis workflows and frameworks for thinking using both structured and unstructured, quantitative and qualitative data.
By using a customizable analysis frameworks, users can easily catalog information contained in large amounts of documents and export it to a variety of formats. Supporting this, DEEP has a long term vision of using text analysis techniques in order to streamline the process of sourcing information from online sources and semi-automating document information extraction. 
Although the platform is meant to be a collaborative space, it is open-source and available to be deployed in private server environments.
Data in DEEP is visible only to users granted access to a project space and is stored using modern web technology standards.
Development of DEEP began in early 2016 and it is a collaborative project governed by ACAPS, IDMC, IFRC, JIPS, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN OCHA, OHCHR and Okular-Analytics.
