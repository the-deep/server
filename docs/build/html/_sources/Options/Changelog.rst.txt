DEEP is an open source, community driven
web application to intelligently collect, tag, analyze and 
export secondary data. This repository contains code for DEEP 2.0,
a large full-stack rewrite of DEEP 1.0.

DEEP's brain is powered by DEEPL, an suite of tools to provide NLP 
recommendations to the platform. Its code can be found here: https://github.com/the-deep/deepl.
