COVID-19 Legislative Measures: A Shift from Easing Quarantine Measures to Reinforcing Them</strong></p><p>In August 2020, the Ukrainian government switched from easing the quarantine measures to once again reinforcing them. In relation to the humanitarian context, the main updates include:</p><ul><li><p>Adaptive2 quarantine is prolonged until 31 October 2020. Range of the restrictive measures depends on the regional quarantine regime (green, yellow, orange or red) which is decided on the basis of certain indicators by the regional Commissions on Technogenic and Environmental Safety and Emergency Situations. Latest information on the quarantine regime in particular regions is available on the governmental website;</p></li><li><p>Self-isolation/Observation after crossing EECPs or the state border: On 27 August 2020, the Cabinet issued Resolution No. 757 renewing the requirement for self-isolation (if not possible &ndash; observation) for individuals crossing EECPs in NGCA and Crimea in the direction of GCA (exceptions are provided for children under 12 years old, staff of international and diplomatic organisations, if negative COVID-test is obtained, and in some other cases). In regards to EECPs in Luhansk and Donetsk regions, however, the situation did not change as despite the cancellation of the self-isolation requirement in July 2020, the JFO Commander continued to enforce it.3 The self-isolation requirement is also applied to the citizens arriving back to Ukraine from the countries included to the high-risk list &ndash; however, the requirement does not apply if the person is tested negative for COVID.</p></li><li><p>Movement through EECPs with Crimea has been restricted from 9 August through 27 August with the exception of allowing movement of Ukrainian citizens mainly based on their residency registration.Other grounds for movement include &lsquo;humanitarian cases&rsquo; (on a case by case basis with the approval of the Head of the State Border Service), movement of staff members of diplomatic and humanitarian missions, and movement of school graduates applying to Ukrainian universities. Movement to mainland Ukraine is mostly conditioned on undergoing a 14-day-long self-isolation;</p></li><li><p>Movement of non-nationals to Ukraine is once again banned, effective from 28 August 2020 &ndash; with certain exceptions. For instance, entry is allowed for non-nationals who are parents/children/spouse of Ukrainian citizens, possess valid Ukrainian work or residency permits, or work for diplomatic or consulate institutions or accredited international missions (including their family members). Entry is also allowed for non-nationals studying in Ukraine or serving in the Armed Forces, persons arriving for short-term transit purpose, experts invited to Ukraine by national enterprises or the state bodies, cargo drivers, and refugees</p></li></ul>                      ]]>

The survey is a part of the monitoring of violations of rights of conflict-affected populations within the framework of the project &lsquo;Advocacy, Protection, and Legal Assistance to IDPs&rsquo; implemented by R2P, with the support of UNHCR. The purpose of the survey is to explore reasons and concerns of those traveling from the NGCA to the GCA, as well as conditions and risks associated with crossing the line of contact through EECPs. The information collected in the survey helps identify protection needs, gaps, and trends, and provides an evidentiary basis for advocacy efforts.</p>                      ]]>

                <div class="tag country">Country: Ukraine</div><div class="tag source">Source: UN Development Programme</div><p><strong>15,000 protective respirators will help medical workers in Donetsk Oblast respond effectively and safely to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong></p><p>Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, September 15, 2020 &ndash; The European Union and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine have donated a batch of 15,000 N95 valveless respirators to four medical facilities in Donetsk Oblast to help them respond effectively and safely to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The personal protective equipment was purchased at a cost of U.S. $50,476 under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme with financial support from the European Union. This was made possible thanks to the joint efforts of the EU and UN, and the ongoing partnership with European partners to help medical workers combat the pandemic and increase the resilience of medical facilities in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>The N95 respirator is designed to block up to 95% of the smallest aerosol particles and filter out viruses and bacteria. This respirator provides better protection than a surgical mask or homemade protective equipment, as it can filter both large and small air particles.  </p><p>The coordinator of the Local Governance and Decentralisation Reform Component of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, Olena Ruditch, noted that the rapid increase in the incidence of COVID-19 is leading to overload in many hospitals in the country, including eastern Ukraine.  </p><p>&ldquo;The proper protection of medical staff is essential to reduce the increase of infectious cases among medics, so we make every effort to ensure that medical institutions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are provided with such protection,&rdquo; Ms. Ruditch added.  </p><p>N95 respirators are designed for single use. However, unlike conventional medical masks, they fit tightly over the face and protect healthcare workers from infectious drops that they may inhale when in contact with patients, or when transporting patients to the medical facilities, or during diagnosis, and while providing subsequent treatment.
Ihor Kiiashko, Head of the Regional Centre for Emergency Care and Disaster Medicine, thanked the international partners for their systematic support in overcoming the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and building the capacity of medical institutions.  </p><p>&ldquo;Every day, the Emergency Medical Care and Disaster Medicine Centre receives dozens of calls from patients with fever, including a large percentage of people with COVID-19,&rdquo; Mr. Kiiashko added. &ldquo;The staff of the centre accompanies patients during hospitalization to medical institutions, risking their own health on a daily basis, and the new respirators will help to significantly reduce this danger.&rdquo;</p><p>Four hospitals in the Donetsk Oblast received N95 valveless respirators, namely: Bakhmut Intensive Care Hospital, Kostiantynivka Infectious Diseases Hospital, Myrnohrad Infectious Diseases Hospital and the Emergency Medical Care and Disaster Medicine Centre in Kramatorsk.
A batch of N95 respirators will soon be provided to medical institutions in Luhansk Oblast as well.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).</p><p>Thirteen international partners support the Programme: the European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.</p><p><strong>Media enquiries</strong></p><p>Maksym Kytsiuk, Communications Associate, the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, maksym.kytsiuk@undp.org, +380 63 576 1839</p>                      ]]>
