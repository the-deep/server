COVID-19 Legislative Measures: A Shift from Easing Quarantine Measures to Reinforcing Them</strong></p><p>In August 2020, the Ukrainian government switched from easing the quarantine measures to once again reinforcing them. In relation to the humanitarian context, the main updates include:</p><ul><li><p>Adaptive2 quarantine is prolonged until 31 October 2020. Range of the restrictive measures depends on the regional quarantine regime (green, yellow, orange or red) which is decided on the basis of certain indicators by the regional Commissions on Technogenic and Environmental Safety and Emergency Situations. Latest information on the quarantine regime in particular regions is available on the governmental website;</p></li><li><p>Self-isolation/Observation after crossing EECPs or the state border: On 27 August 2020, the Cabinet issued Resolution No. 757 renewing the requirement for self-isolation (if not possible &ndash; observation) for individuals crossing EECPs in NGCA and Crimea in the direction of GCA (exceptions are provided for children under 12 years old, staff of international and diplomatic organisations, if negative COVID-test is obtained, and in some other cases). In regards to EECPs in Luhansk and Donetsk regions, however, the situation did not change as despite the cancellation of the self-isolation requirement in July 2020, the JFO Commander continued to enforce it.3 The self-isolation requirement is also applied to the citizens arriving back to Ukraine from the countries included to the high-risk list &ndash; however, the requirement does not apply if the person is tested negative for COVID.</p></li><li><p>Movement through EECPs with Crimea has been restricted from 9 August through 27 August with the exception of allowing movement of Ukrainian citizens mainly based on their residency registration.Other grounds for movement include &lsquo;humanitarian cases&rsquo; (on a case by case basis with the approval of the Head of the State Border Service), movement of staff members of diplomatic and humanitarian missions, and movement of school graduates applying to Ukrainian universities. Movement to mainland Ukraine is mostly conditioned on undergoing a 14-day-long self-isolation;</p></li><li><p>Movement of non-nationals to Ukraine is once again banned, effective from 28 August 2020 &ndash; with certain exceptions. For instance, entry is allowed for non-nationals who are parents/children/spouse of Ukrainian citizens, possess valid Ukrainian work or residency permits, or work for diplomatic or consulate institutions or accredited international missions (including their family members). Entry is also allowed for non-nationals studying in Ukraine or serving in the Armed Forces, persons arriving for short-term transit purpose, experts invited to Ukraine by national enterprises or the state bodies, cargo drivers, and refugees</p></li></ul>                      ]]>

                <div class="tag country">Country: Ukraine</div><div class="tag source">Source: UN Development Programme</div><p><strong>15,000 protective respirators will help medical workers in Donetsk Oblast respond effectively and safely to the COVID-19 pandemic</strong></p><p>Kramatorsk, Donetsk Oblast, September 15, 2020 &ndash; The European Union and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine have donated a batch of 15,000 N95 valveless respirators to four medical facilities in Donetsk Oblast to help them respond effectively and safely to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The personal protective equipment was purchased at a cost of U.S. $50,476 under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme with financial support from the European Union. This was made possible thanks to the joint efforts of the EU and UN, and the ongoing partnership with European partners to help medical workers combat the pandemic and increase the resilience of medical facilities in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>The N95 respirator is designed to block up to 95% of the smallest aerosol particles and filter out viruses and bacteria. This respirator provides better protection than a surgical mask or homemade protective equipment, as it can filter both large and small air particles.  </p><p>The coordinator of the Local Governance and Decentralisation Reform Component of the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, Olena Ruditch, noted that the rapid increase in the incidence of COVID-19 is leading to overload in many hospitals in the country, including eastern Ukraine.  </p><p>&ldquo;The proper protection of medical staff is essential to reduce the increase of infectious cases among medics, so we make every effort to ensure that medical institutions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts are provided with such protection,&rdquo; Ms. Ruditch added.  </p><p>N95 respirators are designed for single use. However, unlike conventional medical masks, they fit tightly over the face and protect healthcare workers from infectious drops that they may inhale when in contact with patients, or when transporting patients to the medical facilities, or during diagnosis, and while providing subsequent treatment.
Ihor Kiiashko, Head of the Regional Centre for Emergency Care and Disaster Medicine, thanked the international partners for their systematic support in overcoming the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and building the capacity of medical institutions.  </p><p>&ldquo;Every day, the Emergency Medical Care and Disaster Medicine Centre receives dozens of calls from patients with fever, including a large percentage of people with COVID-19,&rdquo; Mr. Kiiashko added. &ldquo;The staff of the centre accompanies patients during hospitalization to medical institutions, risking their own health on a daily basis, and the new respirators will help to significantly reduce this danger.&rdquo;</p><p>Four hospitals in the Donetsk Oblast received N95 valveless respirators, namely: Bakhmut Intensive Care Hospital, Kostiantynivka Infectious Diseases Hospital, Myrnohrad Infectious Diseases Hospital and the Emergency Medical Care and Disaster Medicine Centre in Kramatorsk.
A batch of N95 respirators will soon be provided to medical institutions in Luhansk Oblast as well.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The United Nations Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme (UN RPP) is being implemented by four United Nations agencies: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).</p><p>Thirteen international partners support the Programme: the European Union (EU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, and the governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.</p><p><strong>Media enquiries</strong></p><p>Maksym Kytsiuk, Communications Associate, the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme, maksym.kytsiuk@undp.org, +380 63 576 1839</p>                      ]]>

UNICEF <a href="https://www.unicef.org/ukraine/en/press-releases/back-school-campaign">is supporting</a> the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) with an informational campaign to ensure children&rsquo;s safety as they return to school during the pandemic.</p></li><li><p>UNICEF <a href="https://www.unicef.org/ukraine/en/press-releases/unicef-calls-strengthen-protection-schools-eastern-ukraine">is calling on</a> the Government of Ukraine to accelerate implementation of the Safe Schools Declaration. Children and teachers in 3,500 educational facilities are continuing to face daily violence as the conflict in eastern Ukraine enters its seventh year.</p></li><li><p>With the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF is expanding awareness communication on basic preventive behaviors, including wearing face masks and social distancing.</p></li><li><p>Following the recent decision to replace &lsquo;baby boxes&rsquo; with monetary support, UNICEF <a href="https://www.unicef.org/ukraine/en/press-releases/unicef-ukraine-calls-government-revamp-baby-box-universal-programme-newborn-children">is encouraging</a> the Government to keep the Baby Box Initiative as critical childcare support for families with children. UNICEF research shows that 80 per cent of parents prefer to receive in-kind support.</p></li><li><p>UNICEF is concerned about the amendments to the National Strategy for Reforming the Institutional Care System that would result in boarding schools being excluded from the de-institutionalization strategy.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Overview of Child Rights</strong></p><p><strong>Child Protection</strong></p><ul><li><p>On 21 August, the Prime Minister introduced a decree with amendments to the National Strategy for Reforming the Institutional Care System for 2017-2026 and to the Resolution &ldquo;On the Procedure for enrolling children for an around-the-clock stay in institutions providing institutional care and upbringing of children.&rdquo; These changes could result in boarding schools being excluded from the de-institutionalization strategy and therefore efforts to find family-based care for over 80-90,000 children would be limited.</p></li><li><p>Further, it is not considering the fact that earlier this year the MoES made a decision to close most of the boarding schools due to the COVID-19 quarantine measures and around 40,000 children were &ldquo;returned&rdquo; to their biological families without prior assessment of the family situation and often with a safety and protection risk to children. In addition, the majority of those children with special education needs due to disability had no further access to online education.</p></li><li><p>UNICEF and partners are continuing to monitor the situation of children in five regions who have been returned from institutions to their families as a result of quarantine restrictions introduced by the Government in response to COVID-19.</p></li><li><p>UNICEF online webinars for social workers and child protection specialists have received over 155,000 views on the social media channels of UNICEF and partners. These webinars provide useful guidance on child protection risks during the pandemic, including on the prevention of child institutionalization as well as the reintegration of children from institutional care back to their families and communities, inclusive education, child safety, and so on.</p></li><li><p>New informational content and materials were produced and distributed to 30,000 social workers on how to use personal protective equipment and talk with families about COVID-19.</p></li><li><p>Over 2,000 social workers and child protection professionals in five regions were provided with personal protective equipment for safe working with families and children.</p></li><li><p>UNICEF is continuing to support the national child rights hotline, which is providing to be in high demand for children, caregivers and parents. During the reporting period, 2,473 beneficiaries received phone consultations, including 80 per cent of girls and women and 52 persons with disabilities. Twenty-four per cent of the calls relate to mental health and psychosocial well-being. Calls related to violence against children remain high at the level of 25 per cent, while 10 per cent are linked to family relationships.</p></li><li><p>With UNICEF assistance, gender-based violence (GBV) mobile teams in eastern Ukraine have provided over 12,000 phone consultations to people in need since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In August alone, GBV teams delivered 3,178 online consultations to people living along the &lsquo;contact line&rsquo;. Nineteen of the calls were from families of children who had returned from boarding institutions and 88 were from persons with disabilities. More than half of all reported cases are related to violence, and 14 per cent are linked to COVID-19.</p></li></ul>                      ]]>

The equipment enables more than 44 frontline hospitals to help patients recover from severe illness due to COVID-19. These supplies cover critical equipment needs of the most COVID-19 affected areas in Ukraine, including such regions as Lviv, Chernivtsi, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Kyiv and Uman cities.</p><p>The equipment was procured by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, with funding from the EU, through the Solidarity for Health Initiative. The goods are valued at over EUR 78 000. </p><p>Oxygen concentrators are a non-invasive way of providing oxygen to patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Such supplemental oxygen is the first essential step for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients with low blood oxygen levels and should be a primary focus for treatment. </p><p>After necessary administrative steps by authorities, the oxygen concentrators will be distributed by the WHO Country Office according to the needs of the healthcare facilities identified by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.</p><p>All the equipment delivered has been checked to ensure it meets quality and safety standards.</p><p>&ldquo;The pandemic is not over. The spread of COVID-19 in Ukraine is alarming and requires coordinated action from all. Through the Solidarity for Health Initiative, the EU and the World Health Organisation are providing emergency assistance to respond to critical medical needs. Thanks to our partnership, we were able to purchase and deliver, despite the worldwide shortage, oxygen concentrators which are essential to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients in 44 hospitals across the entire country. It is now very important to proceed urgently with the clearance of these critical supplies in order to allow frontline hospitals to benefit from them. This is part of the European Union&rsquo;s #TeamEurope approach, in the context of which it is mobilising a COVID-response package of EUR 190 million for Ukraine.&ldquo; Ambassador Matti Maasikas, Head of European Union Delegation to Ukraine said. </p><p>&ldquo;In the context of the Coronavirus crisis, WHO is working to maximize the availability of critical medical supplies to the most vulnerable. We are focused on fulfilling urgent requests and really appreciate that with the Solidarity for Health Initiative project we are making a difference in Ukraine. Delivery of these oxygen concentrators will be crucial in treating the most severely affected patients in the areas with the highest numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19&ldquo;, underlined WHO Representative in Ukraine Dr. Jarno Habicht.</p><p>&ldquo;In response to the COVID-19 pandemic it is very important not only to respond quickly to all challenges which the health system was facing at the beginning of the crisis, but also to ensure prompt and structured response for later. Increasing the capacity of frontline hospitals in the most COVID-19 affected areas in Ukraine to treat severe cases of COVID-19 is vital as it helps to reduce the burden on health systems and support people who are bravely fighting the virus &ldquo;, added Deputy Minister of Health (MoH) and Chief State Sanitary Doctor of Ukraine Dr. Viktor Liashko.</p><p>In the first phase of the project, a shipment of around one million units of personal protective equipment for 50 COVID-19 dedicated hospitals and essential supplies for 27 COVID-19 laboratories were procured and delivered.</p><p>The provision of these critical supplies is part of the European Union&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, currently affecting more than 216 countries and territories. The total COVID-19 response package from the EU for Ukraine is EUR 190 million. The funds are being used for emergency needs in healthcare, longer-term strengthening of the health sector, as well as socioeconomic recovery. Ukraine is also set to benefit from a special Macro-Financial Assistance worth EUR 1.2 billion.</p><p>The project builds upon the European Union&rsquo;s and WHO&rsquo;s ongoing support to Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Background information:</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Solidarity for Health Initiative&rdquo; is a joint effort of the European Union and WHO Regional Office for Europe in six countries of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus &ndash; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine. The project is aimed to help prevent, detect and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Neighbourhood&rsquo;s capacity to respond to public health emergencies. The project is implemented by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and WHO country offices, in close coordination with EU Delegations, national authorities and development partners, including those in the United Nations system.</p><p>The role of the WHO Country Office in Ukraine is to support the country in creating and strengthening policies for sustainable health development. This includes providing technical guidance in public health-related issues, supporting the development of standards and guidelines, building up local relationships for efficient technical cooperation, and ensuring that public health measures are coordinated and in place during crises.</p><p>Currently, the Country Office in Ukraine is focusing its work on COVID-19 response and cooperation with the health authorities and other institutions involved in the country-level coordination, planning, and monitoring, case investigation, infection prevention and control. WHO has been supporting improving the national and regional capacities to diagnose COVID-19 via the national laboratory system, and also improving clinical standards and approaches in the country.</p><p>For additional information, please contact: Dolhova Tetiana, Communication Officer dolhovat@who.int</p>                      ]]>

                <div class="tag country">Country: Ukraine</div><div class="tag source">Source: Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</div><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p><p><em>Kamensk-Shakhtinskiy, Russian Federation. The Observer Mission (OM) continues to operate 24/7 at both Border Crossing Points (BCPs). The overall number of border crossings by persons increased at both BCPs compared to the previous week.</em></p><p><strong>OPERATIONAL REMARKS</strong></p><p>The OM is currently operating with 22 permanent international Mission members, including the Chief Observer (CO) and one first responder<a href="https://www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk/463710#_ftn1">[1]</a>. The Mission is supported administratively by a staff member and the Chief of Fund Administration based in Vienna. In the framework of its vehicle replacement process with the OSCE SMM, on 14 September three new vehicles were delivered to the Mission&rsquo;s Office in Kamensk-Shakhtinskiy.</p><p><strong>Update on COVID-19 measures</strong></p><p>Activities have been impacted by COVID-19 and measures undertaken by the OM to ensure the safety and duty of care of its Mission members and compliance with measures set by the host country authorities. The Mission is continuing to keep the situation under review, in close contact with the OSCE Secretariat and the Chairmanship. Following the host country recommendations, the observers are adhering to social distancing. Due to the preventive measures taken by the central and regional authorities, the OM is faced with certain difficulties, but is still able to continue to fulfil its mandate without any limitations in its observation and reporting activities.</p><p><strong>OBSERVATIONS AT THE BORDER CROSSING POINTS</strong></p><p><strong>Persons crossing the border</strong></p><p>The profile of persons crossing the border can be categorized as follows:</p><ol><li>Adults travelling on foot or by car with little or no luggage.</li><li>Persons in military-style outfits.</li><li>Families (often including elderly persons and/or children) travelling on foot or by car with a significant amount of luggage.</li></ol><p>The average number of entries/exits increased from 9,544 to 10,017 per day at both BCPs compared to last week<a href="https://www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk/463710#_ftn2">[2]</a>.</p><p>During the reporting period, the majority of border crossings were to the Russian Federation, with an average net flow of 74 per day for both BCPs. The Donetsk BCP continued to experience much more traffic than the Gukovo BCP.</p><p>Responding to the COVID-19 situation, the host country has closed its borders for the majority of foreigners starting from 18 March. Among the exceptions of persons allowed to cross the border (which entered into force on 19 March), are Ukrainian citizens and stateless persons holding passports or identification documents proving permanent residence in certain areas of Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Ukraine. In addition, reportedly, due to the threat of the spread of COVID-19, starting from 10 April, the organized passenger transport commuting between the non-government-controlled areas of Luhansk region of Ukraine and the Russian Federation was temporarily suspended and restored from 25 June.</p><p><strong>Persons in military-style outfits</strong></p><p>During the reporting period, the number of persons in military style outfits crossing the border was eight, compared to ten last week. Six persons crossed into the Russian Federation while another two crossed into Ukraine. These individuals crossed the border on foot.</p><p><strong>Families with a significant amount of luggage</strong></p><p>The OTs continued to report on families, sometimes with elderly persons and/or children, crossing the border at both BCPs with a significant amount of luggage, or travelling in heavily loaded cars. During this reporting week, two families were observed crossing into the Russian Federation while another three families were observed crossing into Ukraine, compared to the previous reporting period when six families were observed crossing to the Russian Federation, while another two families crossed into Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Bus connections</strong></p><p>Regular local and long-distance bus connections continued to operate between Ukraine (mostly from/to the Luhansk region) and the Russian Federation. During the reporting period, the OTs observed a decrease in the overall number of buses crossing the border at both BCPs (328 compared to 353 observed during the previous week). There were 167 buses bound for the Russian Federation and 161 bound for Ukraine.</p><p>On some occasions, the OTs noticed the bus drivers removing the itinerary signs from the windshields of their buses, while some buses did not display their route at all. The majority of long-distance buses commuting between the Luhansk region and cities in the Russian Federation had Ukrainian licence plates issued in the Luhansk region. Among the bus connections observed by the OT, the following irregular route of destination was noted: Luhansk &ndash; Sevastopol.</p><p><strong>Trucks</strong></p><p>During the reporting period, the OTs observed an increase in the overall number of trucks crossing the border at both BCPs (957 compared to 842 during the previous reporting week); 498 at the Gukovo BCP and 459 at the Donetsk BCP, 537 of these trucks crossed into the Russian Federation and 420 crossed into Ukraine. Most of the trucks observed by the OTs had Ukrainian licence plates issued in the Luhansk region; however, on a daily basis, the OTs also noted trucks registered in the Russian Federation, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and trucks with &ldquo;LPR&rdquo; plates.</p><p>The OTs also continued to observe tanker trucks crossing the border in both directions. During the reporting period, the OTs observed a slight decrease in the overall number of tanker trucks crossing the border at both BCPs (45 compared to 54 during the previous reporting week). These trucks were observed crossing the border at both BCPs. The trucks had the words &ldquo;Propane&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flammable&rdquo; written across the tanks in either Russian or Ukrainian. The majority of tanker trucks had hazard signs, indicating that they were transporting propane or a mix of propane and butane. All trucks underwent systematic inspection by the Russian Federation officials, which could include an X-ray check. Due to the unfavourable observation position at the Gukovo BCP, the OTs continued to be unable to observe any X-ray checks.</p><p>During the reporting period, the X-ray vehicle at the Donetsk BCP was not operating due to the ongoing construction activities; consequently, no X-ray checks were observed by the OTs.</p><p><strong>Minivans</strong></p><p>The OM continued to observe passenger and cargo minivans<a href="https://www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk/463710#_ftn3">[3]</a> crossing the border in both directions at both BCPs. The OTs observed minivans predominantly with Ukrainian licence plates issued in the Luhansk region; however, the OTs also saw minivans registered in the Russian Federation. During the reporting period, the OTs observed an increase in the overall number of minivans crossing the border at both BCPs (161 compared to 128 observed during the previous week); 78 crossed into the Russian Federation and another 83 into Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Trains</strong></p><p>The OTs continued to pick up the sound of trains on the railway tracks located approximately 150m south-west of the Gukovo BCP. During the reporting week, the OTs heard trains on 24  occasions; the OTs assessed that 12 trains were travelling to the Russian Federation and the remaining 12 trains were travelling to Ukraine (more details are provided in the sections &ldquo;trends and figures at a glance&rdquo; below).</p><p>Visual observation was not possible because of the line of trees located between the train tracks and the BCP.</p><p><strong>Other observations</strong></p><p>The majority of vehicles crossing the border had Ukrainian licence plates issued in the Luhansk region or Russian Federation licence plates. A significant number of vehicles with &ldquo;LPR&rdquo; plates were also observed crossing the border in both directions on a daily basis. The OTs also observed cars with licence plates registered in Georgia.</p><p>On 8 September at 15:05, the OT at the Donetsk BCP observed a group of 17 brand-new ambulance vehicles type UAZ, with no licence plates, entering the BCP from the Russian Federation and queuing at the customs control area. All vehicles underwent customs control procedures and left for Ukraine at 17:20.</p><p>On 9 September at 20:28, the OT at the Donetsk BCP observed a police minivan with Russian Federation licence plates and two police officers inside, entering the BCP from the Russian Federation and parking next to the main building. At 20:35, the police vehicle drove back to the Russian Federation.</p><p>On 14 September at 13:31, the OT at the Donetsk BCP observed an ambulance with Russian Federation licence plates, entering the BCP from the Russian Federation and parking next to the main building. The OT noticed three individuals on board &ndash; the driver and two medical personnel. At 13:56, the ambulance drove back to the Russian Federation. The OT was unable to notice any other details from its position.</p><p><strong>For trends and figures at a glance covering the period from 11 August to 15 September 2020, please see <a href="https://www.osce.org/files/2020-09-15%20OM%20Weekly%20Update.pdf">the attachment here</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk/463710#_ftnref1">[1]</a> First responders are OSCE staff or Mission members deployed for a short period of time.</p><p><a href="https://www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk/463710#_ftnref2">[2]</a>Based on data received from the Regional Representation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.</p><p><a href="https://www.osce.org/observer-mission-at-russian-checkpoints-gukovo-and-donetsk/463710#_ftnref3">[3]</a> Cargo minivans: light commercial vehicles with a maximum authorized mass of more than 3.5 t and not more than 7.5 t; with or without a trailer with a maximum mass of less than 750 kg (small cargo vehicles which correspond to driving licence C1).</p>                      ]]>

                <div class="tag country">Country: Ukraine</div><div class="tag source">Source: International Organization for Migration</div><p><strong>Kyiv</strong> - On Tuesday (15/09), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is announcing details of a new project to provide modern and affordable housing to over 1,500 people in Ukraine's conflict-affected east. These apartments and houses will be located in the towns of Kramatorsk (Donetsk Region) and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk Region). They will shelter 500 families. </p><p>Over the six years of protracted displacement in the country, caused by the conflict which erupted in 2014, IOM has recorded thousands of cases of displaced individuals and families for whom safe housing remains a pressing need.  The latest IOM survey, conducted between April and June this year, revealed that only 11 per cent of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine own their homes. </p><p>The EUR 22.1 million, five-year project, funded by the Government of Germany through <a href="https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/International-financing/KfW-Development-Bank/Tasks-and-goals/">KfW Development Bank</a>, envisages both new construction and renovation of existing housing units, work to be implemented by IOM in cooperation with the Government of Ukraine and municipal authorities. </p><p>The housing units will require affordable rent payments from the beneficiaries, who will also pay their own utility bills. High standards for construction---including energy efficiency and environment protection---will be featured. </p><p>Eighty per cent of the new residents will be IDPs and 20 per cent will be from the original population of Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk. The towns were selected for the project due to high influx of IDPs --50,000 and 40,000 respectively -- representing about one third of the pre-conflict population of each city. </p><p>"When we fled our home, a priest gave us a village house for free. But another 16 people already lived there. It was basically a hut with just one table, one oven and one bathtub. I was already pregnant with my second child, and we lived in the hallway, where there no place to put the second crib. So, we moved to a flat, the cheapest one we could find, which the wind blew right through," explained one displaced woman from Luhansk Region, eastern Ukraine, who shared her story in an anonymous IOM survey. </p><p>"If we want to work towards a dignified and prosperous future for conflict-affected communities, we must complement our relief and recovery support with interventions that stem from our deep understanding of the long-term impact of protracted displacement," said Anh Nguyen, Chief of Mission at IOM Ukraine. </p><p>"Not only will these new apartment buildings provide homes for the needy, the initiative also represents a significant boost to urban development of Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk and a positive socio-economic signal for the entire region," he added. </p><p>As many as 60 per cent of displaced people live in rented accommodation, and 17 per cent stay with relatives or host families. </p><p>IOM has been working in Ukraine since 1996 and has scaled up its response since 2014. It has assisted over 514,000 vulnerable IDPs and people in need in 24 regions of Ukraine, providing them with humanitarian aid, livelihood grants, and opportunities for community development and social cohesion. </p><p>For more information please contact Varvara Zhluktenko at IOM Ukraine, Tel: + 38 044 568 50 15, +38 067 447 97 92, Email: <em>vzhluktenko@iom.int</em></p>                      ]]>

It found that 72% of facilities reported limited access to hand sanitizer with 11% having no stock at all. 29% of facilities reported problems with their source of drinking water. 55% of health facilities did not have paper towels at all, including 12 out of 18 designated COVID-19 hospitals. When taken together, the data emphasizes that improvements to water sanitation and hygiene conditions at health facilities throughout Ukraine, could make a significant impact in improving Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) within health facilities. These guidelines aim to help international and local agencies to support local authorities in improving hygiene and IPC, at health facilities, by combining international recommendations and good practice with standards recommended in Ukrainian law. The document should be read in conjunction with &ldquo;Key Actions&rdquo; identified in the WASH and Infection Prevention and Control in Health Care Facilities, Guidance Note <a href="https://washcluster.net/covid-19/wash-and-infection-prevention-and-control-health-care-facilities-23-march-2020-eng-fr-sp">(UNICEF, 2020)</a></p>                      ]]>

                <div class="tag country">Country: Ukraine</div><div class="tag source">Source: International Committee of the Red Cross</div><p>On the International Day to Protect Education from Attack, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) presents accounts of children, born in the first year of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and of their parents about their respective expectations from the first year of school: &ldquo;My children have never seen a peaceful sky&rdquo;.
The children&rsquo;s everyday life, their daily roundabouts and school expectations are shown in 59 photos made in different towns and villages along the conflict&rsquo;s contact line in the Donbas.</p><p>Many schools, kindergartens and other educational institutions in eastern Ukraine have been affected by the armed conflict; some of them directly damaged by shelling and shooting. Even nowadays, more than six years into the conflict, educational institutions continue being directly affected by hostilities. For many children, the daily walk to school can be dangerous, and in some cases the education process in schools situated on the very line of contact is interrupted by armed hostilities.</p><p>Within the broader Access to Education Framework, the ICRC delegation in Ukraine is using a multidisciplinary approach to address the situation of people affected by the conflict in the Donbas, and tries to improve safety of schools and kindergartens, thus contributing to the creation of a child-friendly atmosphere and safe environment. The ICRC&rsquo;s Safer Access to Education program also aims to increase risk awareness among children, their teachers and parents, to improve evacuation procedures, and to reinforce their resilience.</p><p>Key activities include safe behavior development, providing a safe environment for children and the wider school community and helping them cope with the effects of the conflict: mine risk awareness sessions, psychosocial support and training sessions for teachers, distribution of educational and child development materials, anti-blast protective measures, repair/rehabilitation of educational infrastructure, enhancement of school kitchen facilities, creation of safe play spaces, provision of play and sports equipment, equipping of school basements/improvised shelters and provision of first aid training and kits.</p><p>Since 2015, this ICRC program has been extended to hundreds of educational institutions along the 450-km long conflict&rsquo;s contact line in the Donbas.</p><p><a href="http://ua.icrc.org/2020/09/08/the-first-generation-of-children-raised-during-the-conflict-in-eastern-ukraine-begin-their-first-school-year/">Click here for photo exhibition</a></p>                      ]]>
